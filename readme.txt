== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add a sitewide message? =

To add a sitewide message go to your admin area > Settings > Comment Form Message. Then select the content types on which this message should appear and enter a suitable message. Make sure that you have selected yes to "Show sitewide message?". Save the changes.

= How do I add a message on a specific post? =

Edit the post or content type you want to add a message to and scroll down to the "Comment Form Message" box. If you can't see that box select "Screen Options" from the top right corner and make sure "Comment Form Message" is checked. 

= When I move the Comment Form Message box on the post edit screen I can no longer edit the message =

This is a known issue and is because of a technical limitation in the use of the visual editor in a meta box. The convenience of the visual editor outweighs the downside of this bug.

To avoid this issue don't move the comment form message box around. If you did move the box around just reload the page and it will be ok (save your post first if you like).

= What languages does this plugin support? =

The plugin is in English by default but you can translate it to your language. The POT language file is located in the languages sub-directory. 

Also the plugin uses abd_libs for admin options so you will need to translate the language file for that as well. You will find that in includes/languages.

Please share your language files (.po) for inclusion with the plugin. The plugin author monitors the [support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/comment-form-message) so just make a new thread there.
